# Portfolio Project
This is a personal portfolio project developed using Next.js and TailwindCSS. The purpose of this project is to learn how to work with Next.js and TypeScript, and to showcase my skills in building responsive, dynamic, and maintainable web applications.

Getting Started
First, run the development server:

bash
Salin kode
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Features
Developed with Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation.
Styled using TailwindCSS for efficient and responsive design.
Written in TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
Utilizes next/font for optimizing and loading custom Google Fonts.
